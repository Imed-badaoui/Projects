# Projects

This repository provides an overview of the main data science and AI projects I have worked on during my studies at T√©l√©com SudParis and Institut Mines-T√©l√©com Business School.

Each project focuses on practical applications of machine learning, deep learning, and data analysis.  
While some code cannot be shared publicly due to confidentiality, short summaries are provided to illustrate my technical contributions and problem-solving approach.
